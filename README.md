# Algorithms Project 1
I created a Java API that runs various sorting algorithms that a user selects. Once a user has run a few sorts, they can view the leader board to see which sorting algorithm is best in terms of the the number of comparisons, movements, and time. The Leader board reveals how different list ordererings affect the performance of sorts.

The API is deployed to Heroku, while the Fontend is deployed to Github pages. Here is the link: https://michietuts.github.io/AlgorithmsProjectOne/

*When you are done using the site, please reset the leader board by CTRL clicking the close button on the leader board modal*

### Installation
- To run the API on your local machine, download the code posted to elearning
    - In your favorite terminal type **gradlew bootRun** (or **gradle bootRun** for Unix/Linux machines)
- To run the Frontend on your local machine, pull the code from my github repo: https://github.com/MichieTuts/AlgorithmsProjectOne/
    - In your favorite terminal run **npm install** to install the needed dependencies
    - Run **npm start** to run the server

### Technologies Used
- FrontEnd
    - React.js
    - HTML/CSS/SASS
